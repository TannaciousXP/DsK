# DsK Tech Challenge

Task to use an API endpoint for the following product IDS 143249,142593,141975,150605. Can enter one id or multiple separated by a comma.

## To Run

Open up the index.html in the browser.

### Notes

Funcs:
Functions that relates to the DOM are in scripts.js
Functions that don't relate to the DOM are in helperFuncs.js

Input:
The input field for ids is only accepts [0-9] and comma

It will only type out numbers, after that it will preventDefault until you use a comma.

Fetch Request:
Currently, for the ids provided they all have 0 stock so I included some dummy data for the sorting button.

Please refer to scripts.js ln 232 - 278 and uncomment SIMILATE for the sort btns and comment out the FETECH

Libraries and Frameworks:
None, I decided to use vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS because I believe this will best display my capabilities.
